# Cryptographic Reductions

My solution to 2nd module of Information Security Lab Autumn Semester 2022. This project consists of
8 tasks:

1. Showing that if we can break Schnorr Signature with No Message Attack, we can also solve Discrete
   Logarithm Problem
2. Showing that if we can break Schnorr Signature with Chosen Message Attack, we can also solve Discrete
   Logarithm Problem
3. Showing that if we can break Katz-Wang Signature with No Message Attack, we can also solve Decisional Diffie-Hellman Problem
4. Showing that if we can break Katz-Wang Signature with Chosen Message Attack, we can also solve Decisional Diffie-Hellman Problem
5. Showing that if we have a machine computing Quadratic Self-Map on exponents of group elements, we
   can also solve Computational Diffie-Hellman Problem
6. Showing that if we can solve Computational Diffie Hellman Problem, we can also solve Discrete Logarithm Problem
7. Showing that if we can solve DY05 VUF, we can also solve q-Diffie-Hellman-inversion
   Problem(taking steps from DY05 paper)
8. Showing that we have a RSA\_PKCS scheme that tells attacker if the ciphertext sent is **PKCS
   conforming**, then we can break this RSA\_PKCS scheme(taking steps from the Bleichenbacher paper)

Detailed steps for each reduction can be found in **task_descriptions** folder.
